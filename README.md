GUM - Sequence Graph Library
============================
This library provides fast, efficient, and versatile data structures for
representing sequence graphs:
- GUM provides both dynamic and succinct representations for directed and
  bi-directed sequence graph,
- GUM is written in C++ -- so it's fast,
- GUM is flexible because it is designed to be extended easily using template
  programming,
- GUM provides Python interface so that it can be used interactively in Python,
- GUM works with different file formats: GFA, vg, and graph-tool.
